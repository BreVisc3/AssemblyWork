Choose "x86-64 gcc 12.2” as the compiler

1.	How many instructions are written?
There are 62 instructions

2.	Find an instruction that we did not go over in class and describe it in your own words
We haven’t used movzx in class, but it functions similarly to the normal mov command except it also sets the parts of the 
destination register that were not directly implied by the register reference’s size to 0

3.	Set compiler option to “-O1”, what happened to the number of instructions?
The instruction count dropped down to 58

4.	Find another instruction that we did not go over in class and describe it in your own words
The test instruction is used which performs an and operation to set flags but it doesn’t store the result

5.	Set compiler option to “-O2”, what happened to the number of instructions?
The number of instructions went up to 91

Change compiler to “arm64 msvc v19.33” with no compiler options
6.	How many instructions are written?
There are 112 instructions written

7.	Find an instruction that we did not go over in class and describe it in your own words
This implementation used the uxtb instruction which extracts the least significant byte of the source and stores it in 
the destination operand with 0 to fill the remaining space in the operand

8.	Set compiler option to “-O1”, what happened to the number of instructions?
The number of instructions goes down to 51
